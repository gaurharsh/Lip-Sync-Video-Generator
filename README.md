## Deployment


It seems there might be a misunderstanding. The provided code is written in Python, and the command "npm run deploy" is typically used in JavaScript projects using npm (Node Package Manager). In this context, it would not be applicable to deploy the LipSync AI project using the command "npm run deploy."

To deploy a Python-based project like LipSync AI, you would typically use other deployment methods, such as creating a virtual environment, installing necessary dependencies, and running the Python script directly.

Here's a general outline of how to deploy a Python project like LipSync AI:

Set up the Environment:

Create a virtual environment to manage project dependencies and avoid conflicts with system-wide Python packages.
Install Dependencies:

Activate the virtual environment.
Install the required Python dependencies, which are usually listed in a "requirements.txt" file.
Run the Application:

Execute the Python script responsible for running the LipSync AI application.
Provide the necessary input paths for the audio and video files.
The script will process the input data and generate the lip-synced video.
```
